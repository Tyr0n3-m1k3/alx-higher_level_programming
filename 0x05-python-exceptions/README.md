THIS IS THE 0x05-python-exceptions ALX PROJECT.
DONE BY TYRONE MIKE.
IN THIS PROJECT I LEARNED ABOUT ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS.
In summary, errors are issues in your code related to syntax and logic that may prevent your code from running at all, while exceptions are runtime events or errors that occur during program execution. Exceptions can be caught and handled, allowing your program to recover or provide appropriate feedback to the user.
